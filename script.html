    <!-- About / My Journey -->
    <section id="about">
      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>Growing up, I watched my father work tirelessly, often seven days a week, driven by the desire to provide a positive future for our family. Despite the challenges we faced, his commitment instilled in me values of forgiveness, gratitude, and the importance of balance. Whether we were camping, building fires, or simply tossing a football at the park, he taught me that life is about more than just work—it’s about connection, growth, and living with intention.</p>
      <p>After earning a business degree from the University of Central Florida and spending a transformative year in Barcelona—where I embraced a culture that champions work-life balance—I returned to the fast-paced corporate world. I dabbled in software sales and insurance underwriting, where I quickly learned that efficiency could be improved with small, thoughtful changes. I became passionate about automating mundane tasks and streamlining processes to make work simpler and more fulfilling.</p>

    <!-- Turning Point -->
    <section id="turning-point">
      <h2>A Turning Point</h2>
      <p>However, my corporate journey wasn’t without its challenges. Burnout set in, and when my father was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in early 2024, I was forced to reevaluate my life priorities. I stepped away from my demanding job, choosing instead to spend time with my family and focus on my own well-being. During this period, I rediscovered the joy of hands-on learning—making soap, tending a garden, playing basketball, and even exploring the zen philosophies during a month-long stay in Tokyo.</p>

    <!-- Philosophy & How I Can Help -->
    <section id="philosophy">
